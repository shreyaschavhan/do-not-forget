# do-not-forget
I keep forgetting repositories that I once created for my own benefits, I'll keep them here so that it'll remind me about them. (Gonna pin it to my profile!) This repo is public coz I can't pin a private repo and if I won't pin it, I won't be able to remember I had this repo in my arsenal.
